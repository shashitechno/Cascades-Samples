# HyperLocal App Template

This is a template application for building apps out of websites. It has built in functionality for BlackBerry Maps, BBM, BBM Channels, Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare.

The application is customizable via the *assets/settings.json* file.

If you need to override any of the website's CSS, you can do so in the *settings.css* file just as you would for any webapp, or website.

###How to configure

Setup is pretty simple if you're familiar with JSON, and even if you're not.

All of the settings for the app are configured via the **assets/settings.json
** file.

- Package Name
- Application Name
- Application Description

##Utilities to make things easier

There are a few websites we frequent to make building these apps easier. 

- [JSON Lint](www.jsonlint.com) - After configuring the settings.json file, paste it into JSONLint.com and make sure it's valid. If it's not, the app will not load.
- [Find my Facebook ID](https://findmyfbid.in/) - This website retrieves a Facebook Page ID from a URL.
- [GPS Coords from Address](http://www.characterscounter.com/get-coordinates-google-maps.php) - Type in an address, and get its GPS Coordinates.
- [UUID Generator](http://www.famkruithof.net/uuid/uuidgen) - Easily generate UUIDs for use with BBM.
